excerpt: 'We proved a general well-posedness result for SPDEs on metric measure spaces. Additionally, we identified sufficient conditions for the compact support property and the strong comparison principle for random field solutions of SPDEs on general metric measure spaces. Our framework encompasses the Parabolic Anderson model and the super-Brownian motion density on the Sierpinski gasket and d-regular metric trees.'
