excerpt: “Assuming the existence of a sub-Gaussian heat kernel, I have worked with Besov spaces associated with these heat kernels, establishing a version of the paraproduct estimates and Schauder estimates. Additionally, I computed the Besov norms of Wick powers of the Gaussian free field and am close to solving the $\Phi^4$ equation on certain spaces.”
