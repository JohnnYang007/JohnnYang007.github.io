I am a sixth year graduate student in mathematics at Indiana University - Bloomington working with Prof. Louis (Wai-Tong) Fan [Link](https://sites.google.com/site/louisfanmath/home). I completed my undergraduate degree in mathematics at the University of Arizona, from 2015 to 2018.


During my graduate studies, I specialized in stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs), interacting particle systems, and stochastic modeling. My current research interests focus on SPDEs on metric measure spaces, interacting particle systems, stochastic quantization, and applications in mathematical biology.
