## Research Interests
I am interested in probability theory and its applications to physics and biology. My research focuses on stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs), interacting particle systems, stochastic quantizations and stochastic modeling in biological systems. You can find my research statement [here](/files/RS_Johnny.pdf).

You can find a list of my collaborators [here](/collaborators/).

## Preprint(s)

1. (Preprint) **Two contrasting properties of parabolic SPDEs on metric measure spaces**, with Louis Fan and Zhenyao Sun. [PDF](/files/SPDE%20on%20MMS.pdf)

## Current Projects

### Stochastic PDEs

1. **Singular SPDEs on metric measure spaces**, with Hongyi Chen.


2. **Extinction probability and universality of stochastic FKPP**, with Louis Fan and Adrian Gonzalez Casanova.



### Stochastic Modeling

1. **Spatial stochastic modeling for virus-mutation interactions**, with Louis Fan and John Yin.
